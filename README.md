## Weather Dashboard Details

Once you open the dashboard you will see a few areas.  These include an input for your city search, a current forecast window, and a 5 day forecast card section.  When you enter a location you will see the current and 5 day forecasts for that location and a button will populate showing that you have searched that location.  The last location searched will be saved when you reopen the application.

The data displayed in the forecast window includes the name of the city, the date, the temperature, humidity, UV index, current weather condition, and a weather condition icon.  Most of this data is also displayed inthe 5 day forecast cards with exception to the UV index.
